<h2><a href="http://ipd.barclayconsulting.com/teams/2014/5/" target="_blank">Bestie</a></h2>
<p>Bestie is a wide-angle selfie lens for your iPhone.  I developed bestie as part of a <a href="http://www.tauber.umich.edu/events/integrated-product-development" target="_blank">cross-disciplinary product development course at Michigan</a> collaborating with a team of students from the College of Engineering and the School of Art and Design.

    <p>The West Coast Forum is Michigan Ross' largest career trek, bringing MBA students to the west coast to meet companies and alumni across industries including consulting, healthcare, tech, retail and CPG.  This year the event brought together over 130 MBA students, 20 companies and 120 alumni for two days of networking and company tours.  I served as co-chair for the entire event managing a team of 17 MBAs.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://dripsterapp.appspot.com" target="_blank">Dripster</a></h2>
    <p>Dripster is an iOS app that helps you find artisanal coffee shops in your area.  I built Dripster when I was consulting in NYC and exploring the local coffee scene.  The Dripster backend is a REST web service written in Java running on Google App Engine.  After I started business school I did not make updates to Dripster and it is no longer in the App Store.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://swaiing.github.io/studydeck" target="_blank">Studydeck</a></h2>
    <p>Studydeck was a web app which helps students prepare for the GRE through online flash cards.  I developed and launched Studydeck with two college friends.  After getting only a handful of paying customers we shut it down.  The site was written in CakePHP and with also a lot of jQuery on the front-end.</p>
