Here are some notable projects that I spent time on outside of work that I found interesting.

## [Bestie](http://ipd.barclayconsulting.com/teams/2014/5/) (December 2014)
Bestie is a wide-angle selfie lens for your iPhone that solves the most critical issue facing today's youths—fitting all your friends into #selfie photo.  I worked on bestie as part of a [cross-disciplinary product development course at Michigan](http://www.tauber.umich.edu/events/integrated-product-development) collaborating with a team of students from the College of Engineering and the School of Art and Design.  We spent a semester building a physical product, engaging in the entire product development lifecycle. The course culminated in a tradeshow competition where team bestie came in a close second place out of six teams.  I [expounded more in depth on my experience in a post on the Ross Tech Alums newsletter](http://rosstechalums.com/2014/12/17/selfie-reflection-the-integrated-product-development-experience/).

## [West Coast Forum](http://westcoastforum.org) (October 2014)
The West Coast Forum is Michigan Ross' largest career trek, bringing students interested in working on the west coast to meet companies and alumni across many industries including consulting, healthcare, tech, retail and CPG.  This year the event brought together over 130 MBA students, 20 companies and 120 alumni for two days of networking and company tours.  I served as co-chair for the entire event managing a team of 17 MBAs.  In terms of event planning, this is my magnum opus—orchestrating this event required a lot of forethought, hustle and time spent printing nametags at Staples.

## [Dripster](http://dripsterapp.appspot.com) (July 2013)
Dripster is an iOS app that helps you find artisanal coffee shops in your area.  I built Dripster when I was consulting in NYC and exploring the local coffee scene.  The Dripster backend is a REST web service written in Java running on Google App Engine.  I started business school at Ross after releasing Dripster and didn't have to continue iterating over it.  Despite this, my love of finding new coffee shops persists.

## [Studydeck](http://swaiing.github.io/studydeck/) (May 2011)
Studydeck was a web app which helps students prepare for the GRE through online flash cards.  I developed and launched Studydeck with two college friends.  After getting only a handful of paying customers we shut it down.  The site was written in CakePHP and heavily utilized jQuery for the front-end learning interface.  The [source code was preserved on Github](https://github.com/swaiing/studydeck) for posterity.
