Hello, I'm Stephen :wave:

Iâ€™m a product manager at [Plaid](http://www.plaid.com), working to unlock financial freedom for everyone. Previously, I learned a ton at [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) as it went through hypergrowth (500 -> 9000 employees). In a former life, I worked as a consultant and software developer for clients in financial services. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science at [Colgate University](http://colgate.edu) and my MBA from [Michigan Ross](https://michiganross.umich.edu/).

I originally hail from Boston, but now call the [East Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bay) my home, where I live with my incredible wife and two children :girl: :baby:. I'm always learning and passionate about tech, product management, biz models, startups, identity, building networks, risk, fraud, and being a good father and husband.
