Hello, I'm Stephen. I am a Product Manager at [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com) building our Account Security products. Previously, I worked as a consultant and software developer for clients in Financial Services. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science at [Colgate University](http://colgate.edu) and my MBA from [Michigan Ross](https://michiganross.umich.edu/).

I originally hail from Boston and am thus a diehard Boston sports fan. However, I now call the [East Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bay) my home where I live with my incredible wife.
