Stephen received his undergraduate degree computer science at [Colgate University](http://colgate.edu) and his MBA from [Michigan Ross](https://michiganross.umich.edu/).  For more on what he did in between, please refer to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenwai).

He recently moved to San Francisco and loves the sunny weather and close proximity of awesome parks and trails.  He enjoys life most when he is at the intersection of technology, business and product.

He grew up outside of Boston and is thus a diehard Boston sports fan.  He also likes coffee, ultimate frisbee and traveling.

This site is a collection of his thoughts on the internet, tech, startups, business, behavioral economics and other random shiny things of interest.  These thoughts are solely his own.
